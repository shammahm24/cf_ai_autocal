# AutoCal Project Plan
*AI-Powered Calendar Application on Cloudflare Stack*

## Project Overview

**AutoCal** is an intelligent calendar management system that processes natural language input to create, manage, and optimize calendar events. Built entirely on Cloudflare's infrastructure, it leverages Workers AI, Durable Objects, Workflows, and Pages to deliver a seamless, stateful experience.

### Core Value Proposition
- **Natural Language Processing**: "Book lunch with Sam next Thursday at 1pm" → Structured calendar event
- **Intelligent Conflict Detection**: Automatically identifies scheduling conflicts and suggests resolutions
- **Smart Recommendations**: Determines priority-based actions (cancel, reschedule, contact people)
- **Single-Screen Experience**: Clean, intuitive interface with light/dark theme support

## Technical Architecture

### Stack Components
- **Frontend**: Cloudflare Pages (HTML/JS)
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers
- **AI Processing**: Workers AI (Llama 3.3)
- **Orchestration**: Cloudflare Workflows
- **State Management**: Durable Objects
- **Real-time Features**: Cloudflare Realtime (future enhancement)

### Data Flow
```
User Input → Frontend → Worker (/api/chat) → Workflow → Workers AI → Durable Object → Response
```
