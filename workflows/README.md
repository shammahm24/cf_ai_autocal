# AutoCal Workflows

This directory contains Cloudflare Workflow definitions for coordinating the event processing pipeline.

## Phase 5: Workflow Orchestration

The workflows will be implemented in Phase 5 and will include:

- **calendar-workflow.js**: Main event processing workflow
- **prompts.js**: AI prompt templates for consistent responses

## Workflow Steps (Coming in Phase 5)

1. **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate user input
2. **AI Parsing**: Extract event details using Llama 3.3
3. **Conflict Detection**: Check for scheduling conflicts
4. **Event Storage**: Save to Durable Object
5. **Response Generation**: Format response for frontend

## Current Status

‚è≥ **Phase 1 Complete**: Basic infrastructure in place  
üöß **Phase 2-4**: Prerequisites for workflow implementation  
üìã **Phase 5**: Workflow orchestration (pending)

For now, this directory serves as a placeholder for future workflow definitions.
