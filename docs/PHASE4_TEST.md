# Phase 4 Testing Guide - AI-Powered Natural Language Processing

## Overview
Phase 4 integrates Workers AI (Llama 3.3) to provide sophisticated natural language understanding, event extraction, and conversational capabilities.

## Prerequisites
1. **Worker running**: `cd workers && npm run dev`
2. **Frontend served**: `cd pages && python3 -m http.server 3000`
3. **AI Authentication**: Cloudflare account with Workers AI enabled

## Phase 4 Features to Test

### 1. AI-Powered Event Creation üß†

**Enhanced Natural Language Understanding**:
- `"Book lunch with Sarah tomorrow at 1pm"` ‚Üí Should extract: title, participants, time
- `"Schedule team meeting next Friday from 2 to 3pm"` ‚Üí Should extract: duration, specific time
- `"Doctor appointment next Tuesday morning"` ‚Üí Should suggest business hours
- `"Urgent call with client ASAP"` ‚Üí Should detect urgency and priority

**Expected AI Response Structure**:
```json
{
  "message": "‚úÖ Perfect! I've created 'Lunch with Sarah' for Thursday, September 26, 2024 at 01:00 PM",
  "ai_extraction": {
    "success": true,
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "event": {
      "title": "Lunch with Sarah",
      "datetime": "2024-09-26T13:00:00.000Z",
      "duration": 60,
      "participants": ["Sarah"],
      "type": "meal",
      "priority": "medium"
    }
  },
  "eventCreated": { ... },
  "phase": 4,
  "ai_powered": true
}
```

### 2. Intelligent Conversation Classification üéØ

**Intent Detection Tests**:
- `"What's my schedule today?"` ‚Üí Should classify as `query`
- `"Book lunch tomorrow"` ‚Üí Should classify as `create`
- `"Do I have conflicts?"` ‚Üí Should classify as `conflict_check`
- `"Help me with my calendar"` ‚Üí Should classify as `general`
- `"Change my meeting time"` ‚Üí Should classify as `modify`

**Classification Response**:
```json
{
  "classification": {
    "intent": "query",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "entities": {
      "timeframe": "today",
      "keywords": ["schedule"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Advanced Natural Language Queries üìä

**Complex Query Understanding**:
- `"When is my next meeting with John?"` ‚Üí Should find specific participant
- `"What's my schedule looking like this week?"` ‚Üí Should analyze week view
- `"Am I free tomorrow afternoon?"` ‚Üí Should check availability
- `"Show me all my meal events"` ‚Üí Should filter by event type
- `"How busy am I on Friday?"` ‚Üí Should provide schedule density

**AI Query Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "You have 3 events this week: ...",
  "ai_analysis": {
    "answer": "natural language response",
    "relevant_events": ["event-id-1", "event-id-2"],
    "summary": {
      "count": 3,
      "timeframe": "this week",
      "highlights": ["Busy Tuesday", "Free Friday afternoon"]
    },
    "confidence": 0.9
  }
}
```

### 4. Contextual Conversations üí¨

**Multi-turn Understanding**:
- User: `"Help me schedule a meeting"`
- AI: `"I'd be happy to help! Who should attend and when would you like to meet?"`
- User: `"With Sarah and John, tomorrow at 2pm"`
- AI: `"Perfect! I'll create a meeting with Sarah and John for tomorrow at 2pm"`

**Context Maintenance**:
```json
{
  "ai_conversation": {
    "response": "I'd be happy to help! Who should attend and when?",
    "action_needed": "clarify",
    "follow_up_questions": ["Who should attend?", "What time works best?"],
    "suggestions": ["Try: 'Meeting with John tomorrow at 2pm'"]
  }
}
```

### 5. Fallback Behavior üõ°Ô∏è

**When AI Fails**:
- Should gracefully fall back to Phase 3 parsing
- Response includes `"ai_error"` and `"fallback_used": "phase_3_processing"`
- Basic functionality still works

**Fallback Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "ü§ñ AI processing failed, using basic parsing: [error message]",
  "ai_error": "Invalid AI response: JSON parse error",
  "fallback_used": "phase_3_processing",
  "phase": 4
}
```

## Performance Expectations

### **AI Response Times**:
- **First request**: 5-10 seconds (cold start)
- **Subsequent requests**: 2-4 seconds
- **Fallback response**: <1 second

### **AI Service Availability**:
- **Available**: `ai_enabled: true` in `/api` response
- **Unavailable**: Falls back to Phase 3 automatically

## Test Commands

### **Basic API Test**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8787/api
# Expected: {"phase":4,"ai_enabled":true}
```

### **AI Event Creation**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Session-ID: test-ai" \
  -d '{"command": "Book lunch with Sarah tomorrow at 1pm", "phase": 4}'
```

### **AI Query**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Session-ID: test-ai" \
  -d '{"command": "What is my schedule today?", "phase": 4}'
```

### **AI Classification**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Session-ID: test-ai" \
  -d '{"command": "Help me with my calendar", "phase": 4}'
```

## Advanced Test Scenarios

### **Complex Event Creation**:
1. `"Schedule urgent meeting with development team next Monday from 10am to 11:30am in Conference Room A"`
   - Should extract: title, participants, urgency, duration, location, specific time
   
2. `"Plan birthday dinner for mom next Saturday evening"`
   - Should suggest: evening time, meal duration, personal event type

3. `"Book doctor appointment sometime next week"`
   - Should note ambiguities and ask for clarification

### **Sophisticated Queries**:
1. `"What meetings do I have with Sarah this month?"`
   - Should filter by participant and timeframe
   
2. `"Am I double-booked anywhere?"`
   - Should identify conflicts across all events
   
3. `"When was my last meeting with the marketing team?"`
   - Should search historical events by participant group

### **Conversational Flows**:
1. **Event Modification**:
   - User: `"Change my lunch meeting"`
   - AI: `"Which lunch meeting would you like to modify? I see you have lunch with Sarah tomorrow."`
   
2. **Scheduling Conflicts**:
   - User: `"Book meeting tomorrow at 1pm"`
   - AI: `"I notice you already have lunch with Sarah at 1pm tomorrow. Would you like me to suggest alternative times?"`
